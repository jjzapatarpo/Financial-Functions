    "Binomial Trees are a useful technique for pricing options and other derivatives. They represent different possible price paths that might be followed by the asset underlying the derivatives contract. The general assumption for binomial trees is that the underlying's price follows a random walk. They also incorporate the argument of no-arbitrage and the principle of risk-neutral valuation.\n",

    "This function is able to calculate both European and American options using binomial trees. It also displays the whole tree structure. Any number of steps can be calculated, and results for European options should converge to the results given by the Black-Scholes model."
